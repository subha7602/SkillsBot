# Skills Bot  

## Overview  
Skills Bot is an AI-powered resume retrieval and analysis system that allows users to search for candidates based on specific skills and experience. It leverages FAISS for vector-based resume search and ChatGroq for generating structured responses from retrieved resume data.  

## Features  
- Automated resume processing: Extracts text from PDFs and splits it into meaningful chunks.  
- FAISS vector search: Enables fast and efficient retrieval of relevant resumes.  
- AI-powered insights: Uses ChatGroq to generate structured responses based on retrieved resume sections.  
- Environment management: Uses dotenv for secure API key handling.  

## Setup & Installation  

### Prerequisites  
Ensure you have the following installed:  
- Python 3.8+  
- pip package manager  
- virtualenv (optional but recommended)  

### Install Dependencies  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```  

### Environment Variables  
Create a `.env` file and add your Groq API key:  
```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```  

## Usage  

### Create Resume Vector Store  
Run the script to process resumes and generate a FAISS index:  
```bash
python vector_store.py
```  

### Query Resumes  
To retrieve relevant resumes based on a user query:  
```python
from query import query_resumes
response = query_resumes("Find candidates with AWS and Python experience")
print(response)
```  

## Technologies Used  
- LangChain for document processing and AI-based responses  
- FAISS for efficient similarity search  
- Hugging Face embeddings for converting text into vector embeddings  
- ChatGroq (Mixtral-8x7b-32768) for generating structured AI responses  

## Future Enhancements  
- Add support for Docx and TXT resumes  
- Implement a web-based UI for easier interaction  
- Improve query processing with fine-tuned LLMs
