# Skills Bot

## Overview
Skills Bot is an AI-powered resume retrieval and analysis system that allows users to search for candidates based on specific skills and experience. It leverages **FAISS** for vector-based resume search and **ChatGroq** for generating structured responses from retrieved resume data.

## Features
- **Automated Resume Processing**: Extracts text from PDFs and splits it into meaningful chunks.
- **FAISS Vector Search**: Enables fast and efficient retrieval of relevant resumes.
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Uses ChatGroq to generate structured responses based on retrieved resume sections.
- **Environment Management**: Uses `dotenv` for secure API key handling.

## Setup & Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- `pip` package manager
- `virtualenv` (optional but recommended)

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file and add your **Groq API key**:
```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Usage
### 1. Create Resume Vector Store
Run the script to process resumes and generate a FAISS index:
```bash
python vector_store.py
```

### 2. Query Resumes
To retrieve relevant resumes based on a user query:
```python
from query import query_resumes
response = query_resumes("Find candidates with AWS and Python experience")
print(response)
```

## Technologies Used
- **LangChain**: For document processing and AI-based responses.
- **FAISS**: For efficient similarity search.
- **Hugging Face Embeddings**: Converts text into vector embeddings.
- **ChatGroq (Mixtral-8x7b-32768)**: Generates structured AI responses.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for **Docx** and **TXT** resumes.
- Implement a **web-based UI** for easier interaction.
- Improve query processing with **fine-tuned LLMs**.
